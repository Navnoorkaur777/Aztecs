        and customs. Although people are turning modern today, hold on to the moral values and celebrates the festivals according to customs.<br> So, we are still living and learning epic lessons from Ramayana and Mahabharata. Also, people still throng
        Gurudwaras, temples, churches, and mosques.

                Theatre is an ancient aesthetic practice in India. Surviving play texts and treatises all suggest that theatre existed in the Indian subcontinent from the dawn of civilization.
                <br> According to the Natyashastra (compiled probably between 2000 BCE and 2nd century CE) of Bharata, an exhaustive treatise on the art of performance, drama was a gift from the gods to the humans. The treatise evinces how sophisticated
                ancient Indian theatre must have been.<br><br>But nowdays modern cinema has taken over , there are very few and ethentic places left who still performs ancient form of theatre They need help from YOU . help them to maintain this tradition.
